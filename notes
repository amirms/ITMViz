intLDA.h

//counts
c -> nd: IntegerMatrix

//states:
findsamp = zsamp = init = zinit = List of Lists
qsamp = qinit = NumericMatrix

//edges
edges= NONE by convention

//variants
variants is a list of tuple list(dtnode, leafmap)

//leafmap
leafmap is a numericVector not a list

TODO Items:
1) May need to change List variants to type vector<node*>! May require populating the items 

DONE 2)  Calculate log of weighing term (for y-sampling) in multinode.cpp has to be fixed

3) Fix variants in multi_node: there should be two copies or not? may be just add a method to add elements to variants. sounds like a better option!

4) Fix the destructors - make sure data gets deleted in R

DONE 5) Re-implement min and sum functions in C++

6) Garbage collection for C++ objects created in R through calling their relevant destructors

7) Implement a function in node class for cloning objects

8) Throw C++ exception to R for handling

DONE 9) implement min and sum functions in R

10) How to delete R-given objects from C++, say when you call the destructors

DONE 11) Fix the indices of maxind, leafstart and leafmap, to ensure they are consistent with R indexing, while when used in C++, -1 is taken from them
